# GofkGo

A lightweight Kafka-compatible message broker written in Go, focused on adhering closely to the [Kafka wire protocol](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html) for interoperability and learning purposes.

## Goals

- ðŸ§ª Minimal and educational â€” designed for developers who want to understand how Kafka works under the hood
- âš¡ Protocol-faithful â€” parses and responds using Kafka's actual binary protocol
- ðŸš€ Written in idiomatic Go â€” simple concurrency, channels, and TCP-based transport
